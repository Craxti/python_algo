Explanation
The bubble sort algorithm iterates through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process continues until no exchanges need to be made, indicating that the array is sorted.

Operating Time Estimation
Best case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) (if the array is already sorted)

Average case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 )

Worst case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 )
