Explanation
The insertion sort algorithm works by dividing an array into sorted and unsorted parts. It sequentially takes elements from the unsorted part and inserts them into the correct location in the sorted part.

Operating Time Estimation
Best case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) (if the array is already sorted)

Average case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 )

Worst case: 
𝑂
(
𝑛
2
)
O(n 
2
 )
